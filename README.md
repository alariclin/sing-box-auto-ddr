# A-Box

> One-click Linux Network Gateway Toolkit  
> Born May 1, 2026

**A-Box** is a one-click Linux network gateway automation toolkit. It combines service deployment, system tuning, traffic control, access management, health checks, parameter export, network quality testing, and a multilingual terminal UI into a single script.

**Credits:** Thanks to Xray-core, sing-box, Hysteria, and related open-source projects for technical inspiration and ecosystem support. A-Box is an independent automation toolkit.
