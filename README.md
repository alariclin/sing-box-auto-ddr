**A-Box** is an all-in-one Linux network gateway automation toolkit. It integrates proxy service deployment, system tuning, traffic management, access control, service health checks, client configuration export, network quality testing, maintenance safeguards, and a bilingual terminal UI into one standalone Bash script.

**Credits:** Sincere thanks to Xray-core, sing-box, Hysteria, and related open-source projects for technical inspiration and ecosystem support. A-Box is an independent automation orchestration toolkit.

## Core Features

| Module | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| One-click deployment | Installs dependencies, initializes the environment, deploys services, and manages Xray-core, sing-box, and official Hysteria 2. |
| Protocol stack | VLESS-Vision-Reality, VLESS-XHTTP-Reality, Shadowsocks-2022, and Hysteria 2. |
| Standard ports | Vision `443/TCP`, XHTTP `8443/TCP`, HY2 `443/UDP`, SS-2022 `2053/TCP+UDP`; custom ports are validated before deployment. |
| SNI policy | Default REALITY SNI is `www.microsoft.com`. Apple/iCloud-like SNI on non-443 ports triggers a warning and secondary confirmation. Production SNI should be selected with the built-in SNI preference tool. |
| Built-in SNI radar | Local candidate library with full and mini-host modes; no legacy remote SNI script dependency. Scores candidates by HTTPS/TLS metrics, TLS 1.3, ALPN, SAN verification, ASN/topology, and progress reporting. |
| XHTTP export | Exports XHTTP client parameters using `/xhttp`, `stream-one`, HTTP/2 host, and `smux: false` for compatible clients such as Mihomo. |
| Hysteria 2 modes | Supports ACME HTTP-01 and Cloudflare DNS-01 certificate workflows, self-signed certificate pinning, optional masquerade, optional port hopping, and optional Salamander obfuscation. |
| Toolbox | Benchmark, IP quality/streaming/route test, full SNI preference, mini-host SNI preference, Cloudflare WARP manager, 2G Swap, backup/restore, diagnostic bundle, and dry-run preflight. |
| Operations | BBR/FQ tuning, TCP KeepAlive, Fail2Ban, logrotate, health probe, scheduled Geo data update, monthly traffic cutoff, SS-2022 whitelist, `--status`. |
| Maintenance safeguards | Lightweight preflight before protocol deployment; automatic backup before core upgrade; backup prompt before uninstall or environment reset; manual backup/restore; redacted diagnostics. |
| Export formats | URI, terminal QR, Clash/Mihomo YAML, sing-box outbound templates, v2rayN/v2rayNG JSON. |
| Safe deployment | New deployments stop managed services, clean A-Box firewall rules, detect port conflicts, and keep full uninstall/environment reset options available. |

## Toolbox Details

| Submenu | Function | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `1` | System benchmark | Runs `bench.sh` for hardware and download speed testing. |
| `2` | IP quality and route test | Runs Check.Place for IP quality, streaming unlock, and route testing. |
| `3` | Local SNI preference | Runs the full built-in SNI preference library with higher concurrency and deeper verification. |
| `4` | Mini-host local SNI preference | Uses the same candidate library as full mode, but lowers concurrency and verification depth for low-spec hosts. |
| `5` | Cloudflare WARP manager | Downloads and runs a third-party WARP manager for egress IP masking and streaming unlock scenarios. A-Box prints SHA256 and requires strong confirmation before execution. |
| `6` | 2G Swap allocation | Creates `/swapfile` to reduce OOM risk on low-memory hosts. |
| `7` | Backup / Restore | Creates or restores A-Box configuration backups; excludes nested backups, diagnostics, and preflight reports to avoid recursive archive growth. |
| `8` | Redacted diagnostic bundle | Exports service status, ports, versions, logs, firewall snippets, cron entries, and a redacted environment file. Secrets are masked. |
| `9` | Full dry-run preflight check | Runs a non-destructive environment, dependency, network, GitHub, port, service, firewall, and storage check. |

## Maintenance Safeguards

- Lightweight preflight runs automatically before protocol deployment menus `1`-`10`. It checks root/TTY, OS/init support, CPU architecture, required commands, and GitHub API reachability. It does not block on ports already held by A-Box managed services.
- Menu `15` creates an automatic backup before core upgrade actions without resetting node parameters.
- Menus `16` and `17` ask whether to create a backup before uninstall or environment reset.
- Toolbox submenu `7` provides manual backup and restore.
- Toolbox submenu `8` exports a redacted diagnostic bundle. UUIDs, private keys, passwords, tokens, and client links are masked.
- Toolbox submenu `9` runs a full dry-run preflight report and saves it under `/etc/ddr/preflight/`.
- Third-party toolbox scripts are not part of A-Box. Before execution, A-Box displays the downloaded script SHA256 and requires the exact confirmation phrase `YES-RUN-UNTRUSTED`, unless `ABOX_REMOTE_SHA256_ALLOWLIST` explicitly contains the hash.
- OTA from the `main` branch is guarded by syntax/fingerprint validation plus SHA256 display and exact confirmation `YES-UPDATE-MAIN`; set `ABOX_OTA_SHA256_ALLOWLIST` to require a known hash.

## Recommended Deployment Schemes

| Scenario | Recommended option |
| :--- | :--- |
| Balanced production deployment | Menu `5`: Xray + Official HY2 all-in-one. |
| Low-memory lightweight deployment | Menu `10`: sing-box all-in-one. |
| Primary TCP path | Menu `1`: Xray VLESS-Vision-Reality (`443/TCP`). |
| High-throughput desktop backup | Menu `2`: Xray VLESS-XHTTP-Reality (`8443/TCP`). |
| Mobile or lossy network | Menu `4`: Official Hysteria 2 (`443/UDP`). |
| Relay/landing node | Menu `3`: Xray SS-2022 (`2053/TCP+UDP`) + whitelist. |

## SNI Selection Notes

- Run SNI preference on the VPS, not on your local laptop, because REALITY target quality depends mainly on the VPS-to-target path.
- Prefer candidates with `tls13=1`, `san=1`, valid ALPN, and same/near ASN or country when available.
- Avoid API-only, rate-limited, unstable, or abnormal response targets when normal `200` web/document/static-resource targets are available.
- Do not use raw IP addresses as SNI.
- Apple/iCloud-like SNI on non-443 ports is explicitly warned by the script.
- The fallback REALITY SNI is `www.microsoft.com`; Apple/iCloud domains are never used as built-in defaults.

## FAQ

### The script says no interactive TTY is available.
Run it from an interactive terminal. If a pipeline environment fails, download the script first and run `sudo bash A-Box.sh`.

### Deployment failed because a port is occupied.
The script checks for non-A-Box processes using selected ports. Release the port manually or choose a different port during deployment.

### Will preflight block reinstalling an already deployed stack?
No. The lightweight preflight used before protocol deployment does not fail just because A-Box-managed services already hold ports. Actual deployment still stops managed services before writing the new stack.

### What is included in backups and diagnostics?
Backups preserve A-Box configuration, service files, scripts, selected firewall/cron state, and related runtime metadata. Diagnostic bundles are redacted and intended for issue reporting or troubleshooting.

### Why does Hysteria 2 ask for up/down bandwidth?
Hysteria 2 uses the configured `up` and `down` values as bandwidth control and congestion-control parameters. Set them according to the VPS line capacity; overly low values can cap throughput.

### ACME certificate application failed.
For HTTP-01, make sure `80/TCP` is reachable and not occupied. For Cloudflare DNS-01, make sure the API token has DNS edit permission for the target zone.

### How should I choose SNI?
Use Toolbox menu `3` or `4`. Prefer results with TLS 1.3, SAN match, valid ALPN, and reasonable ASN/topology relationship with the VPS.

### Why did services stop after reaching the monthly traffic limit?
Menu `18` can enforce a monthly vnStat quota. Disable or adjust the quota there, then restart services.
